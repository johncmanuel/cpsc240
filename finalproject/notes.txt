Algorithm for 1-digit calculator 4-30-24:

1. Read string input from user containing all operations
2. Store string to use for printing it back
3. Create a variable for storing result of calculator
4. Store three characters at a time in register(s) to process results
5. For each character in string:
    - If len(collectedCharacters) == 3:
        - Process calculations
        - Store result in variable
        - Remove contents of collectedCharacters
        - continue;
    - If character == number, store int(character) in a register or array
    - If character in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
        - Store character in register or array
    - Repeat iteration
6. Print result
7. End program
